# ERASE App
 
A mobile app that detects and classifies trash using a YOLOv4 model, converted to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for efficient on-device processing. It identifies waste types (plastic, paper, metal, etc.) and determines recyclability, helping users sort trash correctly and promote recycling.
